                <p>I am Rachel. I am exceedingly sarcastic, to the point where most people think I'm odd, rude, or overall serious. I am not.</p> 
                
                <p>I was born and raised in San Diego. I attended unremarkable schools and did nothing of amazing value throughout my life. I used to draw a lot of cartoons as a child, although, I have fallen out of that in recent years. I took some community college classes, including multiple math classes that I took for fun. But I really hit gold when I took a set building class for theatre. I really enjoyed the carpentry of the class and quickly became a regular of the class and a favorite of the teachers. I ended up taking all versions of the class (Sets I, Sets II, Sets III, etc) for a total of 3 years before I had to abandon the class for a full-time job.</p>

                <p>Nowadays, my days are mostly unextraoridinary, consisting of work, then home. The only thing I really do for fun is gaming. I play online PC games with a set group of gaming friends I have made over the past year or so. We play all sorts of games, but tend to stick to select few. Those being Rainbow 6 Siege, World of Warcraft,and Sea of Thieves. That's it. I have a pretty unremarkable bio. Thanks for bearing through it.</p>
